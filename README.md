- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...Weak supervised learning, supervised and unsupervised learning and more!
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...I love to research ways to increase longevity and life-years. I have read about plant-based lifestyles, blue zones, and listened to several talks on current research being done on how to add more active, healthy years to human's lifespan. This is giving me great insight to diseases such as cancer, heart-disease, and demensia.
